     <h2>Structured Data Website Launch</h2>
     <h4>August 19th, 2011</h4>
     <p>A number of Web developers from the RDFa, Microdata and Microformats 
     communities announce the launch of the Structured Data website and 
     community. There are a number of syntaxes for expressing structured data 
     in HTML today: RDFa, Microdata and Microformats. While each syntax has its 
     own parsing rules and data model, the underlying concept among all of them 
     is the same - to express Structured Data in HTML.</p>

     <p>The <a href="http://structured-data.org/">Structured Data website</a> 
     provides resources to learn about, markup 
     and debug structured data in HTML, including RDFa, Microdata and 
     Microformats. One of the new features, not available anywhere else, is a 
     unified 
     <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/">Structured Data Linting Service</a>, 
     complete with Google Rich 
     Snippets and <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/examples/">schema.org examples</a>
     in both Microdata and RDFa format. The 
     Structured Data Linter provides a unified service for verifying and 
     visualizing the structured data contained in web pages, and supports the 
     RDFa and Microdata syntaxes, with Microformats support on the way.</p>

     <p>At the time of this announcement, the Google
     and Microsoft testing tools do not support schema.org markup in
     RDFa or Microdata. The need for such linting service has been expressed 
     many times on the schema.org mailing list and we are happy to announce 
     that the service is now available. Gregg Kellogg has been instrumental
     in creating the linting service with support from St√©phane Corlosquet.
     Web developers may now use the linter 
     service to ensure that their schema.org Microdata or RDFa markup is 
     valid.</p>

     <p>The Structured Data Linting Service is a beta launch and thus contains 
     a number of bugs. That said, we felt that it would be best to get this 
     tool into the hands of the Web developer community. We invite the Web 
     developer community to try it out, 
     <a href="https://github.com/structured-data/linter/issues">report bugs</a>, 
     <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/structured-data-dev">suggest new features</a>
     and contribute new ideas and code. All of the source 
     code is released under 
     a public domain dedication and is 
     <a href="https://github.com/structured-data/">available on github</a>.</p>
